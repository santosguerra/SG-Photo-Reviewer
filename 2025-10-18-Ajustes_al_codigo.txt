● I've completed all the requested work for version 1.1.0 of the Photo Reviewer
  application. Here's what was accomplished:

  Completed Tasks

  1. Fixed Grid Vertical Spacing Issue

  - Root cause identified: The .photo-item:hover { transform: scale(1.02) } was causing
  photos to overlap when hovered
  - Solution: Replaced the scale transform with visual-only effects (box-shadow and
  border) that don't affect layout
  - This resolved the "fotos pegadas verticalmente" (photos stuck together vertically)
  problem

  2. Implemented Complete Video Support

  Backend (app.py:1-800+):
  - Added support for video formats: .MP4, .MOV, .MKV, .AVI, .M4V (case insensitive)
  - Created generate_video_thumbnail() function using OpenCV to extract first frame
  - Added /api/video endpoint for video streaming
  - Integrated videos into scan, move, restore, and delete operations
  - Added media_type field to distinguish videos from photos

  Frontend (style.css, app.js):
  - Added purple "VIDEO" badge styling
  - Added play icon (▶) overlay on video thumbnails
  - Modified carousel to support HTML5 video player with native controls
  - Videos maintain all mark/unmark/navigation functionality

  3. Added File Names Display

  - All thumbnails now show the file name (without extension) below the image
  - Names longer than 20 characters are truncated with "..."
  - Full name appears on hover tooltip
  - Styled with gradient background for readability

  4. Updated Version and Documentation

  - Version bumped from 1.0.7 to 1.1.0 (new feature release)
  - Updated version.json with current date
  - Added comprehensive changelog to CSS header
  - Added docstring to app.py documenting new video features
  - Added opencv-python==4.8.1.78 to requirements.txt

  Files Modified

  1. /home/santosg/photo-reviewer/app.py - Video support backend
  2. /home/santosg/photo-reviewer/static/css/style.css - Grid fix, video badges, play
  icons, file names
  3. /home/santosg/photo-reviewer/static/js/app.js - Video rendering and carousel
  playback
  4. /home/santosg/photo-reviewer/templates/index.html - Added video element to carousel
  5. /home/santosg/photo-reviewer/requirements.txt - Added OpenCV dependency
  6. /home/santosg/photo-reviewer/version.json - Updated to 1.1.0

  All requested features are now implemented and ready for testing. The application
  should now properly handle both photos and videos with consistent spacing and
  professional UI elements.
